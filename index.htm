    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>We've all seen the problems that compulsive use of social  media can cause, especially for young people. While all social media usage  isn&rsquo;t necessarily bad, there are real dangers when usage is uncontrolled or unsupervised.  Consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Over half of young cell phone users have been victims of cyber bullying  (and less than 10% of them will ask for help)</li>
      <li>Texting while driving causes more accidents than drunken driving</li>
      <li>95% of teens have been exposed to online pornography</li>
      <li>Social media is a primary gateway to sex trafficking and other predatory  situations.  </li>
      <li>There is a serious lack of knowledge by parents, school administrators,  youth leaders and peers on how to help. </li>
  </ul>
  </div>
			<div style="flex-grow: 9">
    <h2>Our Solution</h2>
    <p>We've assembled a  team of training and social media experts to develop  an online training course to teach adults to  identify when social media use becomes a problem and to assist those who are  struggling with compulsive or dangerous usage.&nbsp;  This course will be available to parents, teachers, youth  leaders and care-givers to assist them to understand the dangers of  social media overuse, and how to help.  </p>
    <p>The Screen Safe  program will be offered on a subscription basis and will include an online  training course and updates will be sent covering current  social media threats and the tools and methods needed to protect those  you care about. </p>
    <p>The  program will include chapters on the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Defining&nbsp;the Problem</li>
      <li>The Danger Apps</li>
      <li>Recognizing Problem Usage</li>
      <li>What Actions Can I Take?</li>
      <li>What's Next? - Resources for Parents, Teachers &amp;  Youth Leaders</li>
      </ul>
    <p><img src="images/funding.fw.png" width="132" height="100" alt="funding needed stamp" class="float-left"/>The  development script is complete, and the interface has been designed, but  donations are needed to complete and launch the program. All funding will go directly to the development  of this critically needed program. </p>

    <p><strong>Distracted driving</strong> - Cell phones have made distracted driving a national epidemic. State  patrol officers who deal with crashes every day see the phone as the new &lsquo;open  bottle&rsquo; in the car that makes drivers impaired and dangerous. </p>
    <p>Texting  violations have increased&nbsp;steadily since 2012, contributing to an average  of nearly 60 distracted driving deaths in Minnesota each year.  (<em>MN.  Depart. of Public Safety, 2018</em>).  </p>

    <p><strong>Sex Trafficking</strong> – Children on their phones are experiencing an increase of  exposure to predators posing as &lsquo;friends.&rsquo;. Traffickers worldwide are  increasingly using social media to contact vulnerable teenagers and sell them  into sex work. Once limited to luring victims in the street, traffickers can  now message thousands of people through Instagram, Facebook, Kik, Tagged and  Twitter, with WhatsApp and Snapchat some of the latest tools in their arsenal.  (<em>The Thomson Reuters Foundation, 2015)</em></p>
    <p>&quot;It takes 24 hours to traffic a kid from the time they meet  them online. 24 hours.&quot;  <em>(Cathie Bledsoe, the Indiana State Police  Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, 20180</em></p>

    <p><strong>Pornography </strong>- Over 90% of teens have been exposed to pornography  online. As many as 26 percent of teens have participated in sexting (either  sending or receiving) explicit photos of themselves or others. (<em>Multiple studies).</em>       The average age a person in the U.S. is  first exposed to pornography is approximately five years old. &nbsp;(<em>The availability of obscene material on the  internet. </em> Laaser, M. (2000.)  Pornography can be harmful to persons of any age and the dangers are many.  Pornography teaches unrealistic and inappropriate sexual expectations,  decreases satisfaction with monogamy and lowers family loyalties, objectifies  and degrades women, links sex with violence and children, encourages  promiscuity, and increases susceptibility to sexually acting out in ways  harmful to others.

    <p><strong>Digital games</strong> can be addictive, and those addicted  to them need help. (<em>The World Health  Organization, 2018</em>)</p>
    <p>The effect of social media on the teen brain is a  well-documented research topic.&nbsp; Students are being diagnosed with social  media addictions that complicate their course of treatment in drug  rehabilitation centers</p>

    <p><strong>Cyber Bullying</strong> - Technology has increased exposure to ridicule and  bullying exponentially.&nbsp; One classmate&rsquo;s mean-spirited remark on social  media can quickly morph into an all-out cyber campaign of hate with victim's  exposed to nonstop bullying, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
    <p>Half of our teens have been the victim of cyberbullying,  and only 10% will ask for help.  </p>

    <p><strong>
    Problem Behavior</strong> - Steady diet of technology we consume is delaying the  development of the prefrontal cortex of the brain. This coupled with the fairly  well-developed reward system which manages pleasure and reward can why their  behaviors often seem totally irrational.</p>
    <p>According to Theresa Battle, Asst. Superintendent St. Paul Schools,  &ldquo;The students are coming in much more  stressed. Some of them are dealing with significant trauma and they do not have  the positive tools to deal with conflicts and stress, and it is exacerbated  with teenagers&rsquo; use of social media,&rdquo; </p>

      <span class="phase-text2">The &quot;Screen Safe&quot; Program</span></p>
    <p><strong>Phase #1 Funding Goal</strong> of the Screen Safe program is $30,000. This program is in production now and as  funds are raised they will be used to enrich the depth of the program.  Enhancements include hiring actors to portray compulsive users and the correct,  and incorrect responses by parents to unhealthy behavior. These scenes will be  taped and edited by video professionals. We'll add additional interactions to  more fully involve the users of the program in the subjects covered. Additionally,  we're currently forming focus groups of young social media users to provide  input about the most current apps and the new dangers. We'd like to offer  stipends to the youth who are dedicating their time to this project and this is  all part of our phase #1 development.</p>
    <p>Please partner with us to make this program all it can  be. Click on &quot;Our Team&quot; to see some of the dedicated professionals  donating their time to helping this program become reality. Without their help  the Screen Safe program would cost approximately $70,000 to produce.

    <p><strong>Phase #2 Funding</strong> – When the  initial production funding is attained we will continue into Phase 2  development. This program component is a quality, bound and illustrated leaders  guide to facilitate discussion within the family, youth groups and school  classes. This leaders guide will sync with the material presented in the online  &ldquo;Screen Safe&rdquo; program and can be used as either a stand-alone study or used in  connection with the online program. Because encouraging open discussion between  young social media users and responsible adults, the leaders guide is a  critical part of the overall Screen Safe program.  <strong>Stretch  Goal # 1 is $15,000</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Phase #3 Funding</strong> – When both  the Phase #1 and Phase #2 production funding is reached we will move to Phase  3, which is development of a second online training program directed at youth  ages 5 to 15. This program will provide valuable training on keeping safe while  online. This program is intended to be completed by a young person prior to or  in connection with getting a first mobile device. It will contain a number of  video scenarios enacting the possible dangers associated with social media. It  will include guidelines on how the young person can enjoy safe and responsible  device use. Upon successful completion of the program a graduation certificate  can be printed to be shown to parents and teachers and as a reminder to the  youth to stay &quot;Screen Safe&quot;. <strong>Phase  #3 goal is also $15,000.</strong></p>
