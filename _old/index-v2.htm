    <p>We've all seen the problems that compulsive use  of social media can cause. All social media usage isn&rsquo;t bad, but like many  things there are dangers when usage is uncontrolled and unsupervised. Consider:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Over half of young cell phone users have been victims of cyber bullying  (and less than 10% of them will ask for help)</li>
      <li>Texting while driving causes more accidents than drunken driving</li>
      <li>95% of teens have been exposed to online pornography</li>
      <li>Social media is a primary gateway to sex trafficking and other predatory  situations.  </li>
      <li>There is a serious lack of knowledge by parents, school administrators,  youth leaders and peers on how to help. </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div style="flex-grow: 5">
    <p>To remedy this, we've assembled professional team  to design and develop an online e-learning course to help those who are  searching for a way to assist those who are struggling with social-media  addiction and its effects.  This course  will be available to parents, teachers and care-givers to assist them to  understand the dangers of social media overuse, and how to get help. </p>
    <p>The  Screen Safe program will be offered on a subscription basis and will include an  online training program and regular updates sent to you covering the latest  social media threats, and the tools and methods needed to protect those you  care about. </p>
    <p>Your funding will go directly to the development  of this critically needed program to help those in positions of responsibility  recognize and minimize harmful use.</p>

  <div style="flex-grow: 5">
    <p><strong><img src="images/icon-distracted-driving.png" width="125" height="125" alt="" class="float-left"/>Distracted driving</strong> - cell phones have made distracted driving a national epidemic.  State patrol officers who deal with crashes every day see the phone as the new ‘open bottle’ in the car that makes drivers impaired and dangerous.				</p>
  </div>
  <div style="flex-grow: 5">
    <p><strong><img src="images/sex traffiking.jpg" width="125" height="125" alt="" class="float-left"/>Sex Trafficking</strong> – teens on their phones are experiencing an increase of  exposure to pornography and predators posing as &lsquo;friends.&rsquo;  </p>
  </div>
  <div style="flex-grow: 5"><p><strong><img src="images/sleeploss.jpg" width="125" height="125" alt="" class="float-left"/>Sleep Loss</strong> - This constant access to technology is having a profound, yet  not completely understood impact on the developing brain.</p></div>

  <div style="flex-grow: 5">
    <p><strong><img src="images/addicition.jpg" width="125" height="125" alt="" class="float-left"/>Addiction</strong> – the effect of social media on the teen brain is a well-documented research  topic.  Students are being diagnosed with  social media addictions that complicate their course of treatment in drug  rehabilitation centers.  </p>
  </div>
  <div style="flex-grow: 5">
    <p><strong><img src="images/cyberBulling.jpg" width="125" height="125" alt="" class="float-left"/>Cyber Bullying</strong> - Technology has increased exposure to ridicule and bullying  exponentially.  One classmate&rsquo;s  mean-spirited remark on Facebook can quickly morph into an all-out cyber  campaign of spite with victim's exposed to nonstop bullying.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="flex-grow: 5"><p><strong><img src="images/problemBehavior.jpg" width="125" height="125" alt="" class="float-left"/>Problem Behavior</strong> - Steady diet of technology we consume is delaying the  development of the prefrontal cortex of the brain. This coupled with the fairly  well-developed reward system which manages pleasure and reward can why their  behaviors often seem totally irrational.</p></div>

		<h1><span class="center">Use of Funds </span></h1>
				<div class="flex-container">
  <div style="flex-grow: 5">
    <p><strong>Our goal</strong> for Phase 1 of the Screen Safe program  is $30,000. This program is in production now and as funds are raised they will  be used to complete and enhance the program. Enhancements include taping,  editing and inclusion of video segments, addition of interactive scenarios, the  formation of focus groups to provide input about the most current apps and  dangers and the online hosting of the program. </p>
  </div>
  <div style="flex-grow: 5">
    <p><strong>Stretch Goal #1</strong> – If the initial production funding is attained we will move to continue into Phase 2 development, which is a paper leaders guide to facilitate discussion within the family, youth groups and school classes. This leaders guide will sync with the material presented in the online “Screen Safe” program. Stretch Goal # 1 is $15,000</p>
  </div>
  <div style="flex-grow: 5"><p><strong>Stretch Goal #2</strong> – If both the initial production funding and Stretch Goal # 1 is reached we will move to Phase 3, which is development of a second online training program directed at youth ages 5 to 15. This program will provide valuable training on keeping safe while online and is intended to be viewed prior to or in connection with getting a first mobile device. Stretch Goal # 2 is also $15,000</p></div>
